# PY4HDS - Python for Health Data Science 



## Overview
Python is increasingly being used for data science in healthcare. This introductory and interactive course will run over 30 days and will cover the fundamental aspects of programming in Python. The interactive lecture sessions explore the concepts in greater depth, raise questions, and enable participants to better understand the Python programming language. Throughout this course, we will use examples from healthcare.

The program will enable you to:  
- Apply statistical and machine learning approaches to analyze health-related data.

- They acquire the tools and skills to manage very large and diverse datasets across healthcare systems.

- Develop the professional skills – including teamwork, project management, and presentation skills – to work as a successful data scientist in the public or private sector

- It is important to understand the varied roles of a health data scientist within the wider health and health research environment.

- Learn about the key sources of health data, the context in which these data are collected, implications of the context on issues such as data quality, accessibility, bias, and the appropriateness of use to address specific questions

- Study the key issues related to ethics, security, and information governance.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Explain the principles of Python as a programming language

- Outline and apply the interaction with Python

- Define and use essential elements of Python, such as variables and expressions/operators

- Explain and apply data types such as numbers, strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, namespaces, and tuples

- Outline and use if-statements (flow controls)

- Present and practice loop constructs in Python

- Describe the syntax of a function and demonstrate the use of functions

- Demonstrate error handling in Python

- Present the essentials of modules, libraries, file input and output, and best practices

- Apply Python to one data science problem in healthcare
